# TotalUnimodularity.jl

A pure Julia implementation of the polynomial-time algorithm for testing
[total unimodularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unimodular_matrix#Total_unimodularity)
of integer matrices, based on Seymour's decomposition theorem.

## What is Total Unimodularity?

A matrix M with integer entries is **totally unimodular (TU)** if every square
submatrix has determinant in {-1, 0, 1}. Total unimodularity is important in
integer programming: if the constraint matrix of a linear program is TU, then
the LP relaxation always has an integer optimal solution.

Well-known examples of TU matrices include incidence matrices of bipartite
graphs and network matrices.

## Installation

> **Note:** This package is not yet registered in the Julia General Registry.
> To install directly from GitHub:
```julia
] add https://github.com/mcvmcv/TotalUnimodularity.jl
```

Once registered:
```julia
] add TotalUnimodularity
```

## Usage

### Testing for total unimodularity
```julia
using TotalUnimodularity

M = [1  0  1  0
     0  1  1  0
     0  0  1  1]

is_totally_unimodular(M)   # true
```

### Naive test (exponential time, for verification)
```julia
naive_is_totally_unimodular(M)   # true — checks all square submatrices
```

### Seymour decomposition operations

If A and B are both TU, so are their 1-sum, 2-sum, and 3-sum:
```julia
A = [1 0 1; -1 1 0; 0 -1 -1]
B = [1 0; 0 1]

one_sum(A, B)    # block diagonal [A 0; 0 B]
two_sum(A, B)    # 2-sum (requires compatible border structure)
three_sum(A, B)  # 3-sum (requires compatible border structure)
```

### Special matrices
```julia
F_1    # first Seymour special matrix (5×5 TU, non-network)
F_2    # second Seymour special matrix (5×5 TU, non-network)
```

## Algorithm

The implementation follows Schrijver's *Theory of Linear and Integer
Programming* (Chapters 19–20), implementing Theorem 20.3:

1. **Preprocessing:** Remove rows/columns with ≤1 nonzero and linearly
   dependent rows/columns (equal or opposite pairs).
2. **Network matrix test:** Test whether M or its transpose is a network
   matrix (Theorem 20.1).
3. **Special matrix test:** Test whether M is equivalent to F_1 or F_2
   under row/column permutations and ±1 scalings.
4. **Seymour decomposition:** Find a partition M = [A B; C D] with
   rank(B) + rank(C) ≤ 2 (Theorem 20.2), then recurse on the six cases
   of Theorem 20.3.

See [THEORY.md](THEORY.md) for full mathematical details and
[IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md](IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md) for implementation
decisions and known issues.

## Performance

`is_totally_unimodular` works well for matrices up to approximately 6×6.
The Seymour decomposition step (Theorem 20.2) has O((m+n)^8) worst-case
complexity and becomes slow for larger matrices. Performance optimisation
is an open task — contributions welcome.

For verification on small matrices, `naive_is_totally_unimodular` is
available but has exponential time complexity.

## Testing
```julia
] test TotalUnimodularity
```

The test suite verifies `is_totally_unimodular` against
`naive_is_totally_unimodular` on 2000 random matrices of size up to 5×6,
with no disagreements.

## Background

Total unimodularity testing is based on Seymour's decomposition theorem
(Seymour 1980): a matrix is TU if and only if it can be constructed from
network matrices, their transposes, F_1, and F_2 via 1-sums, 2-sums, and
3-sums. This characterisation leads to a polynomial-time recognition
algorithm described in Schrijver (1986).

This package provides the only known pure Julia implementation of this
algorithm.
